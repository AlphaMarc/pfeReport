10 min & If I ask you about compliance, what comes first to mind ? &
\begin{minipage}[t]{\linewidth}%
Start by asking a simple question, might not be directly related to the research, finish the introduction phase, gauge the group. No need to spend much time here.

\multicolumn{3}{c}{\begin{minipage}[t]{.90\linewidth}\begin{center}
The group is not ready to perform yet but we're getting there, continue with easy questions, this theme is not asking for complex or unconscious answers. We are at the same time trying to gain some knowledge on the decision making process which we could use to our advantage.\end{center}\end{minipage}}\\
\noalign{\smallskip}

\arrayrulecolor{Gray}\hline

10 min & Show different words about decision making process and ask the participants to react to them. &
\begin{minipage}[t]{\linewidth}%
This method helps when we want people to react to hints we already have. This is an easy question and will help facilitate speech.
\end{minipage}\\

\noalign{\smallskip}
\hline

5 min & What are the best and worst possible decision making processes ? &
\begin{minipage}[t]{\linewidth}%
By asking them to exaggerate and amplify their stories we get informations on what are the must do and don't. This will reveal in what ways we can make the decision process smoother.

\multicolumn{3}{c}{\begin{minipage}[t]{.90\linewidth}\begin{center}
The group should now be ready to give more important informations. We are trying in this theme to get an understanding of the features they may like in Regorus. Keep in mind that these people might not be the one that use the software.

\noalign{\smallskip}
\arrayrulecolor{Gray}\hline

10 min & Best-worst case scenarios : Business intelligence software features. &

We are asking the participants to imagine what would be their best and worst software features for business process compliance or more broadly business intelligence (user-experience, productivity, scalability, integration).
\end{minipage}\\

\noalign{\smallskip}
\hline

15 min & Wall of words with features of regorus, ask for reaction. &
\begin{minipage}[t]{\linewidth}%
This question is a bit focused to get constructive feedback on the features of Regorus.

\hline

\multicolumn{3}{c}{\begin{minipage}[t]{.90\linewidth}\begin{center}
We start to dig a little bit more with this theme. We are trying to uncover what or who decision makers listen to when having to make a decision. It is important to drill down and go past simple answers. Do not hesitate to spend more time on questions \end{center}\end{minipage}}\\[1cm]

\noalign{\smallskip}
\arrayrulecolor{Gray}\hline

10 min & Think back to the last time you had a doubt about a decision, whom or what did you turn to for advices ? why ?&
\begin{minipage}[t]{\linewidth}%
We are projecting participants in the past in a known situation. They are more likely to give us profound meaningful insights of their behaviour.
\end{minipage}\\

\noalign{\smallskip}
\hline 

10 min & If I ask you about research, what comes to mind ? Or maybe use images of a researcher and a businessman and ask for comments &
\begin{minipage}[t]{\linewidth}%
We are probing to understand how research and researchers are perceived by these decision makers. This might shape a future branding strategy.
\end{minipage}\\

\noalign{\smallskip}
\hline

15 min & How do you feel about using an innovative but unproven software ? &
\begin{minipage}[t]{\linewidth}%
What is the relationship of respondents with innovative, bleeding edge software that are powerful but have not been broadly tested and accepted within the industry. Is the pioneer image attractive ?

\arrayrulecolor{blue}\hline

\multicolumn{3}{l}{%
\textbf{\textcolor{myBlue}{Theme 4 : What motivate the choice for a given software ?}}} \\
\hline

\multicolumn{3}{c}{\begin{minipage}[t]{.90\linewidth}\begin{center}
This is another important theme, we are looking for motivations that lead to the adoption of a given software. If we uncover this we could be able to target the right incentives. As for the previous theme, don't let the participants get away with easy answers, drill to the profound meaning. \end{center}\end{minipage}}\\

\noalign{\smallskip}
\arrayrulecolor{Gray}\hline


15 min & What makes you chose between equally potent softwares (equally priced) ? &
\begin{minipage}[t]{\linewidth}%
We are trying to find non technical reasons that lead to the adoption of a given software. Each reason must be investigated in depth. Time and money are non acceptable answers.
\end{minipage}\\


\noalign{\smallskip}
\hline

10 min & Importance of a strong theoretical basis ? If not important what is ? &
\begin{minipage}[t]{\linewidth}%
Regorus is undoubtedly backed with powerful theories. But is it something we should use when advertising it ? There may be more important concerns such as formal proof of concept, insurance, certifications ?
